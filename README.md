# ImageTiler

Simple image tiler using OpenCV and QT

Requires image sequences named: name_001.type or file0001.type
File sizes limited by 32bit nature.

* This new version is an updated (python 2 to python 3) version which allows larger tiles to be created since the application can now runs as a 64-bit app rather than the previous 32-bit app.
* PySide has also been updated, which will allow for the crude UI to be updated more easily
